This is an application that uses the [Satellizer library](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer) to interact with Instagram. For me, it is serving as an introduction to Angular.js, as well as a refresher in Node.js and MongoDB. Built following [this tutorial](https://hackhands.com/building-instagram-clone-angularjs-satellizer-nodejs-mongodb).
